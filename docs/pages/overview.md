The Chef Automate Managed Service App (CAMSA) Setup Cookbooks are used to configure the servers that are installed during deployment of the Azure Managed App.

The cookbooks are compiled into policy files that are then packaged up into Habitat packages. This allows the easy updating of components that have already been deployed.
